Today was our last day for code 301. I've learned a ton over the past four weeks and I think we ended up with a really good final project. One thing I learned today was how important testing is, when I came in to start working today I wanted to add a small thing to our project that I couldn't quite get working yesterday. But when I was running the app to test what I had worked on (filtering out bad words from our results), I found two different bugs. This just goes to show how important it is to test early and often. I also learned to rely on my teammates, they made some really great contributions to this project and even when we were all feeling tired and not as motivated they still worked hard and made our app much better than I could have on my own.
