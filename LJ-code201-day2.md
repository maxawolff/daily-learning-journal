Today we learned quite a few things, as well as reviewing some concepts from yesterday. In HTML, we worked a lot with different tags. Some were used for inline styling like bold or emphasis, though this is generally best done in a separate CSS file. While others were entirely different elements like header, article, or aside. These are used to replace <div> and provide more context as to what they represent. We also covered some simple CSS like changing the color or font of a section, and how to target what you want the style to apply to. In javascript we worked with if statements, nothing new but a good refresher regardless.

While working on the homework I got some great practice with using the terminal and git/github. This was what I had the most trouble with on day 1, but after rewatching some of the lecture from that day and having to constantly add, commit, and push to git, I'm feeling much better about it. Overall it went pretty smoothly, though I expect this will only get harder as we go along.
