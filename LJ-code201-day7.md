Today we learned about the constructor functions as well as how to make tables in HTML, which were both fairly straightforward. Constructor functions are like functions that are used to create objects, which can be very useful when you need to make many different types of the same object. In our code yesterday we had made five different shop objects which took up around 250 lines of code, using a constructor function made that code much smaller and easier to read as well. In the future using constructor functions will save a good amount of time. Tables took a while to conceptualize for me. You first create the table, then cerate rows within the table, and finally you make table data, which acts as both the columns within the rows and whatever is held within them. Once I got the grasp of how tables were structured I was able to use them fairly well. We continued to work with DOM manipulation today, and I got better at adding to the DOM by creating elements, filling them with text, and appending them to some other part of the DOM. It's actually very easy to keep adding to the same place since you can keep appending to the same point and each element will be placed directly below it (in terms on html, not necessarily on the page itself). Today felt fairly easy, so far I'm keeping up with everything which is great. Todays lesson really helped to cement what we did yesterday, especially when we coded the objects in class together.
