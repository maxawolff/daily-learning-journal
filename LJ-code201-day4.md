Today we covered functions in Javascript as well as page layout in CSS. We talked about parts of page layout earlier in the week, but now that we've covered some more concepts its starting to make more sense. Positioning an object is not the most intuitive concept to me but like everything else, the more practice and the more familiarity with it the easier it gets. We haven't had to make out about me pages look a certain way yet, so I haven't had a chance to apply the box model and positioning very much yet but I think I should be able to use them well enough.

Function seems pretty straight forward, at least in terms of how we assign and call them. Creating complex functions will be its own challenge but the ones we have done so far have been easy enough. We worked in pairs today, which I found very helpful. Not only did you have a second set of eyes to look at your code and solve any problems, but you also had to explain how to navigate your code without actually typing. This seemed to cement some of the knowledge that I had and was actually fairly difficult at first. It was also nice to see someone else's design as another point of reference.
