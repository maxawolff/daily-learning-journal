Today in class we went over some functional programming concepts, such as using array methods to transform data without actually modifying the original array that we were given. I had seen some of these used before, such as for each, but had never implemented them in my code before. After the code demo, and doing the code challenge relating to functional programming, I can see the benefit. This makes the code look a lot cleaner, rather than using for loops and sometimes nested for loops, using for each or map can reduce the amount of lines that we have and show exactly what we are doing to each item in the array. I'm still learning the syntax but for the most part I understand what is happening.
