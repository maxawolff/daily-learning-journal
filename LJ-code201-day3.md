Today we learned about lists in html, the box model in css, and loops in Javascript. Lists were pretty straight forward, I've used them before and there not too complicated, it will be interesting once we start styling them more using CSS, there's a lot of things you can do with them from changing what they look like to where they appear on the page. CSS is really interesting to me the more I learn about it, actually designing the way a page looks something I haven't done much so I'm curious to see how hard it will be to take an idea for how a site should look and  make it actually happen. Loops didn't seem to complex to me, I was able to use them in the assignment fairly easily, although I only used for loops. Perhaps while loops will be more tricky since we have to avoid infinite loops, but I think I understand them well enough so far.
