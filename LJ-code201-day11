Today in class we covered some chapters that weren't directly related to what we were doing but were still useful. Chapter 19 covered info like search engine optimization and stuff like that, while chapter 9 was about video (no one uses flash I guess), and chapter 16 was about using images in CSS. For the lab we had to make a photo picker and display the results. It was nice to get practice with things we had used before, such as using the DOM, writing functions, and events. Nothing new was learned but review has been very important in my learning so far.
