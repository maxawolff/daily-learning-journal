Today was a difficult day, we spent a lot of time trying to make a proper put request to the text razor api, which would take our reddit data and give us back useful info like how many times certain words were used as well as more complext text analysis. Eventually with a lot of help we got it working and were able to hook up our two api calls to get something back. I'm learning more about planning a project as well as how to deal with issues, its tough but I feel like tomorrow will be a very productive day for our group.
