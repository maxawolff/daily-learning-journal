Today we worked with jQuery again, this time we worked on adding event listeners with it. In the lab we used made the kilovolt blog more functional, having search bars and tabs be usable to show the user more relevant information based on what they clicked on. We also hid most of the articles content until 'show more' was clicked on. So far jQuery has been very helpful, speeding up what we have to do by a ton. I'm still working on getting a better grasp on all of the syntax but I'm sure that will happen eventually.
