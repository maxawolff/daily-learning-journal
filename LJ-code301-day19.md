Today we met MVP for our app. Function calls only happen when we want them to and the app is usable. When you load the page you see a list of subreddits to click on, and once you do it shows you a wordcloud based on what subreddit you clicked on. I learned a lot about how much work a project like this was, by the end of the day today I was feeling mentally exhausted and wasn't able to code like I wanted to. Thats just a result of how much we've been working, so making sure we were focused and prioritizing our tasks properly ended up being very important. Im very impressed with how our team worked on this project, everyone worked really hard and that was helpful, I'm pretty happy with how its turned out so far, hopefully I can fix up a few things tomorrow morning.
