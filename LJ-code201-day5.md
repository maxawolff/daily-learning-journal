Today we talked about the readings and went over code like always, that was fine but where I really learned some stuff was in the lab for today. We had to define some functions and make sure they worked by testing them with pre-written test functions, and that was not easy. I spent a lot of time and energy on this but it was really satisfying to finally get the tests to return a passing message. My dad used to be a programmer and he always talked about loving the problem solving aspect of it, trying to write something and then refining it until it was correct. That's how I felt today, after finishing the fourth function, sumArray, I was actually proud of what I had done and was excited about moving on to the next challenge.

In terms of what I actually learned, I got a much better idea of how functions worked. Working with local variables and then returning the correct one, as well as debugging my code. Its pretty much impossible to get everything correct on the first try, so using the console logs to figure out where things go wrong has been very helpful. Overall I'm feeling great about everything so far, it hasn't been easy but I've been able to do everything so far without too much help, though having someone to bounce ideas off of and explaining my code has been helpful. Week 2 should be tough, but I'm ready for that challenge!
