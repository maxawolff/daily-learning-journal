Today we learned about local storage and how to save data so that it persists even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed. This was very interesting since up until now, our websites never saved anything that we did with them. Our salmon cookies page never remembered when we added a new store and our bus mall page wasn't very useful since it only gathered the information from the current user the most recent time that they picked images. It was difficult  at first, but after we figured out the basics, and spent some time debugging, we were able to get my code up and running without too much difficulty.
