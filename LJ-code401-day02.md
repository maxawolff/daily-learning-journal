Today we learned a lot about python, one cool new thing was tests. Basically tests are pretty straightforward, you write functions that call your actual functions and check if they are  equal to what you expect them to be. I guess I thought it would be more complicated than that. Anyways we also learned recursion which is rarely used, in fact we didn't even use it in our assignment today, but its good to know for interviews I guess. In our lab Powen and I made functions to return values of a sequence given a n value, as well as one that lets you set the first two numbers of that sequence. It went fairly well, I'm getting better at python syntax, also my linter is somehow working correctly now... maybe I fixed it yesterday but I don't think that I did ... spooky
