Today we worked on making an app as a class from the ground up. We were making a pokedex app that would connect with the poekemon api to get information about pokemon and show them on our page. We didn't finish it yet, but so far we have an ajax request that asks the api for data for 20 pokemon, then we take that response and store it as json in our postgres server. With a different method we take that data from our server and append the results in a table, showing a picture of the pokemon as well as its types, id, and name. It has again been helpful to build something from the ground up, especially since that is what we will be doing during project week. Nothing (that I can think of) was new to me, but I've only done this a few times, so I don't remember how to do everything off the top of my head, so having a chance to get more practice with all of the concepts that we have learned is very helpful in familiarizing myself with all of the material.
