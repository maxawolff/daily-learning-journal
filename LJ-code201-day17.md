  Today we worked again on our group project and I learned a lot about CSS and the styling of our pages. I took our ideas, which were only a rough outline, and made them into a fully fledged page layout. It took a lot of time but it wasn't overly difficult, I just took it step by step creating one section at a time. I took some inspiration from the examples of previous projects which we had looked at several classes ago. I also worked on our javascript and learned more about working with forms and how to tell which button a user had clicked on. I also learned about hiding elements so that only one question would show at a time.
