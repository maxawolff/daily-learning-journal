Today we presented our final project for our 201 class. We had made a website that has a user submit some information about a dog that they have, and it matches them with another dog in out system that would be most compatible with them. We also got to see everyone else's project and they all looked really great. It was nice to see everything that the other students chose to do, it gave me some really great ideas about things that could be done either in our project or on a future assignment.
