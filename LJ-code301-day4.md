Today we learned about using the handlebars template. It seems very useful as it much more efficient than writing out a template in the html, grabbing it and cloning it, then changing the data within it and then hiding that original template. It took a while to get the hang of it but after the day 4 lab  I'm starting to understand it better. There are also some more complex things to do with handlebars that was in our reading, but I'll figure that out later. For now handlebars does exactly what I want it to. The flow of this class has been interesting so far, we're slowing building on or knowledge adding one new thing each day. While some seem upset that we didn't do the newest things from the start, I like the approach. We first use what we know, then learn new skills to do that in a better way. After the first few days I was feeling a bit overwhelmed, but now I think I understand everything that we've done so far.
