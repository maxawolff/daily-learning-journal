Today in class we covered some new topics to start out week 2. First we covered objects, then worked with manipulating the DOM using javascript. Objects were confusing at first since they had new rules associated with them, such as using commas after key-value pairs, and methods. Speaking of which the names are different, key-value pairs are like variables and methods are the object equivalent of functions. Objects are actually fairly intuitive, but it takes a while to get used to the notation, as always little mistakes will make code not work which can be frustrating but that's just part of the job. Working with DOM manipulation was actually really interesting. In my lab I created list items and added them to an unordered list that I had previously created in the HTML structure. It will be interesting to see what more complex things we can do with these concepts to make web-pages that are responsive, rather than static. We're in uncharted waters as far as what I know about programing now, so I'm excited and a bit nervous for what will come next. Also I need to dedicate some time to CSS but that really hasn't been my interest so far, I guess we'll see how that progresses as this lab continues.
