Today we learned about forms and events. Forms are a field in your page that can be used to take in user data, whether in the form of a search bar or submission fields for the user to input their info, or even a place to leave comments or blog posts. Forms were fairly easy to figure out, I think the hard part with forms will be their design rather than the code behind them. Events was a much  more complex issue, though it seems like we only scratched the surface on them. We practiced adding a listener to execute some code in JavaScript when a specific even happens, in out case it was the push of a submit button. In the future we will probably be working with more complicated events, but for now responding to the event was easy enough. What we were able to do with the forms and events was quite cool, our sales pages now have the ability to take in user data for a new store and turn it into a new store in the table that we made. I'm excited to see how we can use events to make our page dynamic in the future.
