Well it took 14 days but its finally getting to me. Today we worked with JSON and some stupid assignment that wasn't bus mall but it was using what we did from bus mall. We had to make 5 files today in a group and we spent over 2 hours trying to fix our bugs, the TA's tried really hard but they still couldn't figure out what was wrong. It was really frustrating, in addintion we had 6 damn assignments due today, including a quiz which I didn't really understand. Whatever, I still feel like I'm understanding what we're doing but today really kinda sucked. Brian is honestly an amazing TA, he was very helpful not only trying to de-bug our code but also helping us with being frustrated and talking to us about 401s, can't give him enough praise!
