Today I worked more on CSS and making a responsive layout. I learned how to make a more clean design that looks good on multiple screens instead of just mine. I've learned a lot about CSS over the past few days and have actually enjoyed it much more than I have in the past. I've also learned about working as a team over the past week, how to properly split up tasks and knowing when to stop what I'm working on and help with bigger issues like the functionality of our app. So far I've really enjoyed this project.
