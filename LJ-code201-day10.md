Today in our lecture we went over another example of the cookie-store project and helped to finish what hadn't been done. Even though it was just review for me I found it very helpful and  it tied in with what we had been learning about debugging. So far I have really enjoyed code review, since we are learning so much in a short period of time the extra review has really helped to cement things in my brain so that I really know them. We also watched some 401 projects which was interesting; though I didn't exactly understand how they were doing everything the general concepts all made sense and it was cool to see examples of real projects that fellow students had completed. We also worked on CSS afterwards re-creating a webpage from scratch. It was great practice and a lot of work but in the end our page looked very much like what we were supposed to make. It also gave us an example of working with a deadline and was another instance of pair programing, which I have found helpful thus far. There was even a guest speaker who talked about how to negotiate starting salaries, overall there was a lot that I learned.
