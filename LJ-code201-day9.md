Today was mostly a review day. We reviewed code which was helpful to see how other people were creating and appending their new store data, which actually made me realize that I had a bug in my code from not parsing the form data into a number. Afterwards we went over styling lists, forms, and tables, which was nice since we spent todays lab working on our design and CSS. So far I've found CSS to be fairly uninteresting, there's a lot that can be done with it but I'm much more interested in JavaScript which has more of a problem solving aspect to it. My page looks ok and follows all of the requirements so it will work for now. We also practiced how to approach a problem, first creating a wireframe and then implementing the code. Nick wanted us to make a calculator which we made using a table, with each of the buttons having their own JavaScript that handled what happened when a button was pressed. It was a difficult task, but planning ahead of time made it easier.
