Today we learned about controlling the url from the from end. We've been shown the benefits of a single-page web app, and this is a way to do this even when we have different URLs that show seemingly different pages. Using page.js library, we can specify certain functions that happen when different urls are accessed, meaning we can switch out the html or communicate with the server all from the same page without a reload. This will help keep our users happy as they don't have to wait for a page to refresh. It is also a good idea to have this section (the controller?), seperate from other js pages so that each one does its own thing, this will keep our pages organized.
