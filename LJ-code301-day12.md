Today we learned more about interacting with APIs and what makes a RESTfull API. REST stands for Representational state transfer, this means that ... I'm honestly not sure. It has something to do with the being able to make requests to the url in a clear straightforward way. When we look at a RESTfull API there will be clear requests that can be made from a standardized url, like /api/users/, this could have get and post and update methods associated with it to change or access information. We also worked with API's that need tokens to authenticate the user. This is something that you need to pass in so that you can get access to more of the APIs functionality. A lot of this is still confusing to me but as always with practice I'm sure it will make more sense.
