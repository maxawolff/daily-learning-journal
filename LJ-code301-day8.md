Today we worked with SQL for the first time. We learned how to select items from various tables by querying for them using different conditions. We also learned how to use node to do this rather than programming what Nick called "raw sql". I need to review how to to this last part, writing the sql in the tutorials was fairly straightforward but I got a bit lost in class. Going back over the notes will more than likely clear things up as well as practice making it easier. Learning with stacked modules has been a challenge in this class, I never really feel like I have a firm grasp on the concepts, but I think overall it is still working as intended. I guess we'll see as class goes on how well my understanding of the concepts keeps up.
