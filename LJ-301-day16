Today was the first day of project week and I learned a good amount. First off, the reddit API is not fun, don't use it. We also spent a lot of time working with AJAX calls and dealing with asynchronous issues, it was frustrating since there were a lot of problems, but satisfying when we eventually solved them. Once again we're dealing with making something from scratch without too many directions, which is challenging but also very interesting. It is nice to have this process instead of filling in todo's with very incremental stuff.
