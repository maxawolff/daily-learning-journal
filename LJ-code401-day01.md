Today I learned about different errors that python has and how to make them. I dealt with syntax, name, attribute, and type errors as well as errors that were multiple levels deep.This helps to get a familiarity with what these errors are, so that when we see them in our code (which we will) we have an idea as to what went wrong. I also installed sublime and added some packages to it, though I'm not sure if my linter is correct as it doesn't quite act like other student's linters. I will try to get this sorted out before class tomorrow though I might need help from a TA. We also had a vist from Brandy, and she talked with us about marketing ourselves. It seemed a lot like other talks I have heard from her in 201 and 301, but for some reason this one really resonated with me.
