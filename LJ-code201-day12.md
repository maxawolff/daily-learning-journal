Today I learned a very useful skill, how to figure something out when I hadn't used it before. We talked briefly in class about how to use chart.js, but when it came time to actually use it and manipulate it to do what I want I had little to no idea what to do. So I went to the code demo, but that didn't have everything that I wanted. So I went to the docs, but honestly that didn't have what I was looking for, though I did find a few helpful things. I finally turned to google, which helped me to find the specific answers to questions that I had. So not only did I learn how to make a bar chart, I got valuable practice in solving my own problems and learning something almost from scratch. We also had instructors talk about the 401 classes that they taught. I'm still not sure what class I want to take, but now I have a base understanding of what my options are and I have people who I can ask about the subject. I now need to think about what I like about coding, what my passion is ... I'll get back to you on that one.
