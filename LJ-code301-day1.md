Today in class we covered SMACCS and responsive web design. SMACCS is a way of organizing your CSS so that it is easier to conceptualize, I think. You have different documents based on what you are doing, whether it is for the entire structure of the page or for the content that you are trying to provide. Responsive web design I found to be much more interesting and easy to understand, it means that when you make a site it will display properly regardless of the size of the window. This will allow all users to have a positive experience on your site. Also to note, we are supposed to build our apps from a mobile first perspective, this shows just how popular mobile browsing has become.
