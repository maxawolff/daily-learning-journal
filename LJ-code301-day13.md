Today we learned about deploying our website to Heroku. Unlike GH pages, Heroku allows us to have a sever which allows our sites to be fully functional, storing data on a back-end and calling for it only when needed. It was fairly straightforward, the hardest part was getting the environment variables set up so that we can store things like tokens to access APIs as well as the path to our server, which was provided by Heroku. I haven't yet deployed my portfolio, but I will once it is closer to a finished product. Heroku is very easy to interact with, we used the terminal to create our site from the repository that we made, and then when we had finished with our code we used git to push our work to their site, just as we had done before with GitHub.
