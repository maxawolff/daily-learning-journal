Today I learned a lot about working on a group project. We divided the work up and worked in pairs which was helpful, having someone to bounce ideas off of and to check your work and catch silly mistakes. I also went to the Seattle JS hackers meet up after class and I got some help with event listeners which had been a subject where I had struggled in the past.
