Today we started with a review of what we had been doing, and it was actually very helpful. Rather than work on our labs in the morning, Nick had an lecture in which we all helped to make a project, front and back end, using everything we had done so far. It seemed like everyone was struggling a bit to understand what we had been doing, which was how I felt. Not that I had no idea, its just that we've learned a lot, and rather than making projects from scratch we've been filling in pre-made projects (the kilovolt blog) that tell us what we need to do. While this is helpful in some ways, serving as a good model for what we need to do in our portfolios later, it also didn't really help me conceptualize what I was doing. So when we made something from scratch as a class it was great, we got to see how everything fit together and how to do everything one more time. The stacked modules learning moves very fast, so it was great to take a step back and just review.
